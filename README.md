# LevelDB
This is my modernized fork of [LevelDB.jl](https://github.com/jerryzhenleicai/LevelDB.jl).

The `DB` object mostly acts like an `AbstractDict` except that its size is unknown.

#TODO:
Right now this is quick and dirty for filling an immediate need.  At some point I may either try to
merge it in to the orginal (abandoned) package or create a LevelDB2.jl.
